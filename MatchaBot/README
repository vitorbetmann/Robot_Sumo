Code for MatchaBot, which competed at the York University 2024 Robot Sumo Competition.

Similar in strategy to EspressoBot, even components are the same, but many bugs were
fixed in relation to that code:
- Robot now takes noise readings into consideration for the Ultrasonic Sensor, solving
  issue of robot moving in an arc after detecting opponent. It now moves in a straight
  line.
- Robot now prioritizes attacking over not not losing, which means that if opponent in
  front, it keeps even if going over a white line. This prevents losing in case the
  opponent has a white wedge.
- Code is more modular, easier to read, and better documented.
